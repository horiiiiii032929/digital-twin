# Scripts

Use this folder for repeatable project utilities such as ingestion, evaluation,
data validation, or project automation scripts.

Current utilities:

- `validate_markdown_links.py`: checks local links in repository Markdown files;
  run it with `npm run check:docs`.
- `verify_local_ingestion.py`: parses and chunks five approved synthetic TXT,
  Markdown, and PDF sources twice, then reports stable identifiers, provenance,
  and figure counts; run it with `npm run verify:ingestion`.
