# Course Digital Twin Release

Project board: https://github.com/users/horiiiiii032929/projects/1

The board executes the
[release plan](release-plan.md) within the authoritative
[real-world product scope](../research/00_admin/2026-08-18-real-world-product-scope.md).
Historical closed issues preserve the research and prototype record and are
archived from the live Project view; visible cards track only open product,
evaluation, and delivery work.

## Planning fields

- **Status:** Todo, In Progress, Done. Release goal #8 remains `In Progress` as
  the parent. Keep only one unblocked execution package in progress per
  independent track.
- **Decision:** Pending, Keep, Refine, Go Deeper, Drop.
- **Work Type:** Feature, Research, Design, Prototype, Documentation,
  Evaluation, Bug.
- **Area:** Instructor, Student, AI Agent, RAG, Analytics, Architecture,
  Documentation, Evaluation. GitHub labels add `area:multimodal` and
  `area:platform` where the older select field is too coarse.
- **Risk:** Low, Medium, High.
- **Evidence:** existing result, PR, revision, or limitation reference; never a
  promised result.
- **Sprint:** the active product phase and bounded work package.
- **Target Date:** prospective planning date, not a release claim.

Priority labels provide the critical path: `priority:p0` is work required next,
`priority:p1` is required for the release candidate, and `priority:p2` follows
the release-critical path.

## Release stages and product gates

The release stages are R0 local baseline, R1 hosted release candidate, R2
invite-only pilot, and R3 final project release. Product gates P0-P3 supply the
evidence needed to promote between those stages.

| Gate | Milestone | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Product UX baseline — complete | Merged professor/student conversation-first workspace in PR #83 |
| P1 | Multimodal Product Grounding | Correct metrics, implement region-aware ingestion/retrieval, integrate visual citations, select or retain fallback |
| P2 | Deployable Product Foundation | Identity, durable data/storage, jobs, deployment, observability, security, recovery, and capacity |
| P3 | Pilot Validation and Release | Large factual-QA dataset quality, calibrated fidelity, end-to-end evidence, and approval-gated usability pilot |

The older F1/F2 milestones are closed history. F3 is superseded by P1-P3 after
its open issues were reassigned. F4 remains the report, presentation, and
professor-communication track.

## Critical path

1. #105 — preserve every invalid or unfavorable provider-review attempt and
   keep that reviewer-search loop closed. The corrected 120-case dataset and all
   four human confirmations are frozen. Candidate build 001 now fixes an
   unselectable AnyHit control plus deterministic, GTE cross-encoder, and
   GTE-plus-NLI candidates and passes network-free checks. Publish the build,
   then require separate authorization before opening and running the decision
   split once; select a production answerability gate only after all hard gates
   pass.
2. #107 — preserve T0 as the release control and prepare one separately frozen
   T0/T1 confirmation before staging promotion.
3. #88 — externally blocked on host/domain selection; merged PR #93
   (`adf39af`) retains the passed local/container foundation and recovery
   evidence.
4. #24 — calibrate Professor Digital Twin fidelity against independent expert
   labels, separately from factual QA.
5. #9 and #25 — production operations and deployed end-to-end validation after
   their platform/fidelity dependencies clear.
6. #10 — approval-gated professor/student workflow and usability pilot.

Issue #87 is completed `Keep` history after pilot 003 passed every 100-case
gate in PR #109. Issues #85 and #86 are completed `Refine` history. Issue #110
retains the professor-requested staged scale without making it an active
publication blocker. Issues #13 and #44 remain parallel final-delivery and
professor-communication work.

Issue #86 merged region-aware product ingestion, access-checked original-crop
citations, and three registered prospective development attempts in PR #91.
Attempt 003
passed all quality/integration gates but failed the frozen relative p95 gate, so
no multimodal profile is selected and the text profile remains the fallback.

GitHub parent/sub-issue and blocked-by links encode this order under release
goal #8. Issue #13 and communication ledger #44 remain parallel academic
delivery work and do not substitute for product gates.

## Issue workflow

1. Define the outcome, baseline/control, inputs, metrics, hard gates, failure
   cases, operational measures, privacy boundary, and rollback before work.
2. Use one bounded issue for one measurable decision or product capability.
3. Move only the current unblocked execution item to `In Progress`.
4. Preserve all old results and create corrections rather than overwriting.
5. Add `Evidence` only after an inspectable artifact exists.
6. Close only when implementation, tests, evidence, limitations,
   documentation, rollback, and full checks satisfy the shared definition of
   done.

## Professor checkpoints

Use issue #44 for concise decision-bearing updates. Report the product outcome,
evaluation design, exact sample/metrics when available, one important
limitation, and the next decision. Routine commits remain on the board. Ask the
professor for research, pilot, consent, or fidelity-calibration advice where
their judgment is materially required; do not ask them to choose ordinary
implementation details.

## Safety and claim rules

- Keep private course data, student data, credentials, consent records, and
  bulky run outputs outside Git.
- Do not use solutions, answer keys, or submissions.
- Do not open a held-out split before the prospective candidate and gates are
  frozen.
- Do not treat multi-model agreement as ground truth or LLM judging as a
  replacement for independent expert calibration.
- Do not describe the product as deployed, production-ready, usable, faithful,
  or learning-effective until the corresponding gate passes.
